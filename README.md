# bunny-world-android-game-editor
The goal is to implement an editor for a simple graphical adventure game. The game is called "Bunny World" after its most famous puzzle, but in reality, there's not much bunny in it. The project has two aspects: playing the game, which is relatively easy, and the game editor, which is a complete, graphical, document oriented, OOP/GUI project.
